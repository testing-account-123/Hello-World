Hello World!;
Good morning!;

This is a line of text

I am actually editing this file on Github

function f() {
  console.log("Hello World")
}

function greet() {
  console.log("Sup")
}

greet()

function bye() {
  console.log("Bye")
}

bye()

A little surprise for you!
Have fun!

Wow. I am forking a repo on github and actually this is fun.
Cool!
